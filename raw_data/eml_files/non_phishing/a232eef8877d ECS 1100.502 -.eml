Information regarding Spring 2021 registration is posted on the Course 
Homepage on eLearning. View all the videos and documents in the file to 
understand how registration for classes works.

You will have to submit the Spring 2021 Worksheet and a Flow chart to get 
your "Cannot Register Online" hold removed.  To assist you with the Flow 
chart and worksheet, please refer to your course history in Orion and the 
degree plan I sent you with the listing of courses you are currently in and 
if you completed AP/IB Test Credit or Dual Credit.
