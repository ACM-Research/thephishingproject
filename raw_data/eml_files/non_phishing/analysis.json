Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident.

TITLE Current Status and Future Directions in Wind Farm Modeling SPEAKER Dr. Stefano Leonardi The University of Texas at Dallas DATE November 4 2020 TIME 200PM EDT REGISTER NOW Can't make the scheduled time? Register and we'll send you the recording of the complete webinar. ABSTRACT In recent years the wind energy industry has experienced a considerable technological and economical expansion leading to the design of large and dense power plants. The flow within wind farms is affected by turbulence atmospheric stability and topography. As the turbines are being placed closer together in order to minimize capital costs such as e.g. land transmission the overall efficiency is being affected by wake interactions between upstream and trailing turbines. Numerical simulations have been instrumental to design wind farms and maximize the power production. However there are still open challenges. For example a better understanding of the meso-microscale coupling is widely regarded as a key aspect for further development of wind energy Veers et al. Science 2019. From a computational fluid mechanics perspective the problem is challenging because the wind varies on time and length scales of the order of days and kilometres while turbulence has length and time scales several order of magnitude smaller. Similarly the effect of the topography on the flow field on the fluctuations of power production and on the durability of the turbines is still an open area of research. In this seminar we will provide a background on the subject review the basic numerical techniques to model wind turbines and present our recent results coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting WRF model and our in-house high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation code Santoni et al. Wind Energy 23 2020. We will also discuss a stochastic approach to estimate the annual energy production and assess optimization strategies. BIOGRAPHY Stefano Leonardi is a professor at theMacintosh HDUsersleonardiPicturessleo-picture.png Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Texas at Dallas. He got a Master degree in Aeronautical Engineering 1999 and a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics 2002 at the University of Rome La Sapienza Italy. He was Assistant Professor from 2006 to 2010 and Associate professor from 2010 to 2013 at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. He joined UTD in 2013. From 2007-2010 he was also Adjunct Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy New York and since 2010 he is adjunct professor at the University of Southampton UK. He is Associate Editor in Frontiers in Energy Research - Wind Energy. His research interests are in turbulent flows over rough walls heat transfer turbo-machinery super-hydrophobic surfaces wind turbines cardiovascular flow wildfire propagation and oceanography. His numerical results have contributed to an improved understanding of the effect of roughness on turbulent flows and heat transfer and clarified the mechanism of drag reduction in super hydrophobic and liquid infused surfaces. Leonardi's group has also contributed to develop SOWFA and a novel high fidelity CFD code UTD-WF to model wind farms under realistic wind conditions and to evaluate control algorithms optimizing power production. Leonardi's research has been funded by National Science Foundation Office of Naval Research National Institute of Health American Heart Association National Renewable Energy Laboratory Pratt & Whitney and Argonne National Lab. cidimage005.jpg@01D613C7.32AD5BD0 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT Center Director Christopher Niezrecki Ph.D. University of Massachusetts Lowell ChristopherNiezrecki@uml.edu 978-934-2963 Site Director Mario A.

Facilitated by Dr. Stephanie Adams 1200-100pm  Join Microsoft Teams Meeting  Please rsvp here There has been an increase in the level of the conversation about diversity in STEM. Most likely fueled by the current social movement that has achieved world-wide attention. We must take advantage of the current momentum and re-emphasize the need for diversity in STEM. Most STEM fields clearly are struggling to achieve a population that mirrors our national statistics specifically in engineering. Women and racialethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in nearly 100% of STEM fields. Utilizing data from the National Science Foundation and the American Society for Engineering Education ASEE the audience will begin to understand the enormity of this task. Armed with this information the audience will gain a better understanding of the issues and challenges faced in diversifying STEM and hear evidenced based actions and recommendations which will equip you to address them in a positive proactive manner such that we can increase the representation of these marginalized groups.

More than 36K+ joined us from 50+ countries tuning into more than 1K sessions covering 40 topic areas in five languages. If you haven\u2019t yet watched NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote make sure to catch up here - you don\u2019t want to miss the groundbreaking announcements across healthcare data science robotics automotive and more. Over its 11 years NVIDIA GTC has always been about sharing innovative approaches and exploring how accelerated computing and AI are transforming how we work and live. But GTC 2020 took this to a new level. It brought together an incredible collection of talent - developers researchers engineers and technologists - from a variety of industries. More than 1400 people were trained on the latest AI deep learning and data science tools by our Deep Learning Institute  enabling them to shape the next generation of AI-powered applications. And new connections were made during online networking events that were frankly more successful than we ever thought possible. We\u2019re very grateful for your participation. We\u2019d also like to thank our 1100 speakers and more than 80+ sponsors who made this all possible. We hope you enjoyed attending GTC as much as we enjoyed hosting you. To help us make our next event better I kindly ask you to provide your feedback through surveys in the GTC app or your registration dashboard . You can continue learning by exploring sessions you may have missed or revisiting those you found most interesting in the Session Scheduler any time over the next 30 days. We hope to see you again in the spring for our next GTC with even more breakthrough discoveries.

    "body": "Dear All Assignments#1 has been graded and posted on e-Learning. Please check it out and review the TA\u2019s feedbacks. If there is any further question feel free to contact me. It would be great if you consider the following items for the rest of the semester. It helps us to grade the next assignments faster. 1- Before attempting to create a draft of your solutions please read the submission guidelines carefully. If you are asked to submit a single pdf file you are not supposed to upload any other types like word or more than one pdf file. We expect you to submit one pdf file for all 10 questions including the screenshot of the codes and results also a debugged .rkt file for assignment#1 for example. We did not deduct any point if you had not followed those instructions only for the first assignment but if it happens in the future you will get a 10 points penalty unfortunately. 2- Please debug your codes before submission. If we are not able to run your code you may lose all the points considered for that problem. 3- It is very helpful if you check out the questions asked on Piazza regularly. In that way if you misunderstood a question there is this possibility that someone else asked it and you also find the hint there. For example some of you did not get the point of question#1 about drawing the internal representation for the lisp lists however it was asked on Piazza and the hint was given along with the slide number of the relevant lecture note. 4- Please try to read each question carefully. For instance for questions#5 6 and 7 you need to trace your code by one of the given examples but some of you ignored that part and consequently they lost 3 points for each. 5- Please choose your partner for quizzes and those two assignments you are allowed to work with a partner only from the section you are enrolled. If you have enrolled in section 501 you cannot choose your partner from section 503 for example. Otherwise there will be a 10 points penalty for the violation. I highly encourage you to figure out the solution to each problem according to the feedbacks posted on e-Learning if you couldn\u2019t gain full credit of it. It will definitely help you to solve the mid-term or final exam\u2019s problems easily. Best Somayeh M."

I\u2019d love to take this time to go in even more detail around what it means to be a software professional at Intel. WHAT WE DO Chip-making at Intel used to involve a lot of work in sequence but processors systems-on-a-chip SoCs and other silicon products require more steps than before. This challenge spurred a new approach to getting Intel \u00ae silicon and critical software stacks done right the first time compressing tasks and doing more in parallel. Learn how Michale Greene\u2019s team at Intel ensures that all the critical code needed to ship a product is ready to go at launch for our customers. This effort is called \u201cPre-Silicon Software Readiness\u201d. PROJECTS THAT MATTER In April 2017 three prominent organizations in the high-tech world\u2014Intel Alibaba Cloud and LinkDoc\u2014brought top researchers and developers together in a competition to screen for lung cancer in its earliest stages using algorithms and AI. Through this deep collaboration with Tianchi participants across the globe the engineering teams obtained rich insights into the medical imaging analytic domain and better understood the commonality among different solutions. Through research and experimentation we concluded that the traditional graphics processing unit GPU has limitations in this type of analysis while the central processing unit CPU has advantages. \u2013 Albert Hu Senior AI and Big Data Solution Architect Intel Corporation The team from Peking University won the event besting the other 2886 teams involved. However the overall insights gained from this seven-month online project will benefit the entire global medical community.

    "body": "If you are interested in finding an internship or entry-level position I encourage you to begin the preparation needed to be successful in your job search. When you interview your role is to tell stories that describe your skills experiences and passion for your work during the interview. The interviewer will be assessing your stories and delivery to determine if you are the best fit for the position. 1. A good analogy for this is the process that actors use to prepare for their roles. They start by memorizing the script. Once the lines are memorized the focus shifts to gaining mastery of the content delivery by practicing rehearsing. This ensures that the narrative has a social and emotional impact on the audience. Be your own screenwriter by creating stories using situation or task actions and results statements in Power Point a. Situation or task\u2014the most common situations are based on class projects work experience hobby projects volunteer experiences or student leadership activities. Example As part of a four-person team developed working prototype that met the needs of the professor or employer. b. Actions-describe what steps you performed to achieve the desired outcome. For most engineering tasks the design process includes problem definition problem analysis development of possible solutions and selection of the best solution. i. Describe these steps with enough detail to highlight the top level actions and skills used to achieve the results. c. Results\u2014what was the outcome of your actions and what did you learn? 2. Follow this step-by-step process to rehearse your stories. a. Print the notes of the PowerPoint stories and begin practicing your story in front of a mirror or recording on a device. b. Use this practice to refine your delivery. Your stories will become much better and you will gain confidence in yourself. c. Be sure to pay attention to the social and emotional aspects so that you come across as authentic positive confident and capable. This step will prepare you to impress the interviewer. d. Memorization is not enough. 3. Spending a few minutes each day will improve your ability to present yourself as a viable candidate. 4. As you start applying for jobs be aware that many companies use applicant tracking systems that screen resumes for keywords phrases and text strings. Read the job descriptions carefully to make sure you are presenting the right information for each jobemployer. For many students finding a job can be stressful process. By using this process to develop unconscious competence you will be learning a life-skill that will have a major impact on your career. If you haven\u2019t done so I encourage you to create a LinkedIn profile. Employers view LinkedIn as another tool to learn about your skills and experiences. With a one page resume you are limited in the information that you can share. LinkedIn allows you create a portfolio for your activities employment student organizational involvement research academic and hobby projects and recommendations. and start connecting with Jonsson School students and alumni. By monitoring the daily feeds you can view employer posts that have information about events and the recruiting process. One of the easiest and best resources for creating an effective profile is the Learning LinkedIn for Students video by Oliver Schinkten. His video is one of many videos created by recruiting professionals to provide guidance on your job search. You can access the videos at the LinkedIn learning tab on the library\u2019s website. Once you have created a profile click on my profile and then click on connect. I will accept your connection request and then you will be able to view my 23000 LinkedIn connections. Please continue to read my emails as I cover topics that help you prepare for career success.

Facilitated by Dr. Stephanie Adams 1200-100pm  Join Microsoft Teams Meeting  Please rsvp here There has been an increase in the level of the conversation about diversity in STEM. Most likely fueled by the current social movement that has achieved world-wide attention. We must take advantage of the current momentum and re-emphasize the need for diversity in STEM. Most STEM fields clearly are struggling to achieve a population that mirrors our national statistics specifically in engineering. Women and racialethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in nearly 100% of STEM fields. Utilizing data from the National Science Foundation and the American Society for Engineering Education ASEE the audience will begin to understand the enormity of this task. Armed with this information the audience will gain a better understanding of the issues and challenges faced in diversifying STEM and hear evidenced based actions and recommendations which will equip you to address them in a positive proactive manner such that we can increase the representation of these marginalized groups.

For those of you who also had birthdays during August and September I wanted to wish you again a Happy Birthday!

I hope regardless that you can look toward the positives and have hopes of an even greater birthday awaiting you.

    "body": "Dear Student The staff in University Housing hope you are doing well as you prepare for finals this fall. For those interested in staying on-campus during the winter break this serves as a reminder that all campus housing will be open including our residence halls. However you must sign up for housing during the break if you are assigned to the residence halls before November 4. The link for the residence halls can be found here . Our staff are committed to providing you with a safe place to call home and our preparation for your return or continued residence is based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local agencies. This week UT Dallas announced its course modalities for the spring semester. I am sure this announcement has led to some students questioning whether or not they would reside on campus for the spring semester. Let me remind you that the date to cancel your spring 2021 housing without penalty is November 1 2020. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee priority for fall 2021 housing if you do cancel and move out and you would be required to reapply for fall 2021 housing in March 2021. In an effort to support the residential living experience the University will be moving forward with plans to approve limited events and activities during the spring semester. We recognize the importance of being able to connect your friends and classmates and we hope that these opportunities will allow all a way to experience this safely. Please see today\u2019s News Center article for further information. The link to the article can be found here . If you wish to cancel your housing agreement you may email our staff at housing@utdallas.edu to notify us of your intentions with \u201cCancellation 2021\u201d in the subject line. If you are still planning to remain on campus for the spring semester no further action is required. Thank you. Matthew J. Grief Associate Vice President University Housing \u00a92020 The University of Texas at Dallas"

I see that you\u2019re attending University of Texas at Dallas so I wanted to let you know we\u2019re actively on-boarding drivers \u201cDashers\u201d in your area to deliver food and other items from local merchants to hungry customers. In case you haven\u2019t heard of DoorDash before we give customers an easy way to order delivery from well-known restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle and from local restaurants including your college town favorites. Delivering with DoorDash \u201cDashing\u201d doesn't feel like being an everyday delivery driver. When you become a Dasher you\u2019re your own boss and you can choose exactly when and where to work. You\u2019ll learn how to work with local businesses and have the opportunity to interact with people coming from a diverse set of backgrounds. You don\u2019t even need a car  you can deliver from your bike motorcycle scooter or moped if you have one. I\u2019d love for you to sign up if it sounds interesting. You can get started by clicking below. Thanks!

    "body": "Hello There Jerry Teng! A little over a week until Halloween and five weeks until Thanksgiving Day \u2013 can you believe it?? The holiday season is almost upon us the Texas chill is creeping into the air and here we are over seven months later still social distancing. Our celebrations will look different this year and while we certainly understand the craving for normalcy to return we would also like to take this opportunity to urge you to continue to keep safety first especially within our residential community. - When you leave your apartment wear your mask indoors at all times and outdoors when you are not able to keep a social distance of at least a 6ft. from others - Complete your Daily Health Check every day - Abide by the Guest Policy  found on pages 3-4 of the University Housing Resident Handbook - Halloween masks are not a substitute for health masks things are scary enough. Stay Safe Stay Well and we hope to see you at the Presidential Debate Watch Party TONIGHT or at any of the other community and campus events listed below ~  Upcoming Community Programs  Presidential Debate Watch Party Thursday October 22nd at 800pm Join us as we watch and discuss the final Presidential Debate TONIGHT at 800pm \u2013 click here to see the flyer and access the QR codes to livestream the debate and join the discussion! Click here to access a few questions we will be discussing during and after the debate \u2013 and feel free to share and start discussions with your friends and family too! We understand that politics can be polarizing especially during times such as these. Remember the goal is always mutual respect and empathy  so do your best to have constructive conversations and seek first to understand then to be understood. Do you have a voting plan? Do you know who and what will be on your ballot? Our Election 2020 Info Flyer will help you answer these questions so that you arrive at the polls prepared! Wanting to watch something a little less\u2026 consequential? If you missed our last scary movie watch party feel free to watch Insidious the movie on your own or with your roommates and discuss these questions as you watch ! Virtual Book Club Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson Throughout the month of November 2020 Bryan Stevenson\u2019s acclaimed memoir Just Mercy takes the reader inside America\u2019s broken criminal justice system and compels us to confront inequality and injustice .

They will offer two virtual sessions and you are welcome to attend one or both. Registration is required! Wednesday October 14 Deep Learning Overview for Images and Video with MATLAB 100 p.m.-300 p.m. WebEx Deep Learning is a key technology driving the current Artificial Intelligence AI megatrend. You may have heard of some mainstream applications of deep learning but how many of them would you consider applying to your engineering and science applications? MathWorks developers have purpose-built MATLAB's deep learning functionality for engineering and science workflows. We understand that success goes beyond just developing a deep learning model. Ultimately models need to be incorporated into an entire system design workflow to deliver a product or a service to the market. The aim of the session is to provide an overview of how MATLAB enables you to take advantage of disruptive technologies like deep learning. We will * Show where deep learning is being applied in engineering and science and how its driving MATLAB's development. * Demonstrate a workflow for how you can research develop and deploy your own deep learning application. * Outline what MathWorks engineers can do to help support you achieve success with deep learning. Technologies demonstrated include * Automating Ground Truth Image Labeling * Training and Evaluating an Object Detector * Generating optimized native embedded code Wednesday October 14 Data Analysis with MATLAB 300 p.m.-500 p.m. WebEx In this session you will learn how MATLAB can be used to visualize and analyze data perform numerical computations and develop algorithms. Through live demonstrations and examples you will see how MATLAB can help you become more effective in your work. This session is targeted for those who are new to MATLAB. However experienced MATLAB users may also benefit from the session as the engineer will be covering some tips and tricks from the newer releases of MATLAB. Some of the highlights include * Accessing data from many sources excel files other software hardware etc. * Using interactive tools for iterative exploration design and problem solving * Automating and capturing your work in easy-to-write scripts and programs * Sharing your results with others by automatically creating reports For more information on the workshops contact Peter Sheridan at psherida@mathworks.com cidimage001.jpg@01D69AF0.65A159F0"

Mozart's Requiem Mass was composed in 1791 and to this day remains a work every choral singer knows and hopefully sings at some point in their lifetime. When I made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall I knew I had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. I also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. Mozart's Requiem is just that - engaging and attractive. httpsnam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmcusercontent.com%2Fb3dc70d4973eb902913bf929b%2Fimages%2F936db4bd-7f8d-459b-844e-a1e88f05b261.jpg&data=02%7C01%7CAbigail.Thomas2%40UTDallas.edu%7Ca0c0b2bef31d4408ce0308d86c98d874%7C8d281d1d9c4d4bf7b16e032d15de9f6c%7C0%7C0%7C637378751014863640&sdata=crBLt9xYHJm8NZJThK4qLW%2BFT0LaY%2F5uDuqNIRAHECI%3D&reserved=0Chamber Singers' soprano Dyuthi Arella writes \u201cEverything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. Our virtual choir experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice I\u2019m glad I made!\u201d As students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses I feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures of course. There will be more information forthcoming but I do hope you will continue to support choral music at UT Dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon.

    "body": "This is a very challenging time for students and employers. Because of the uncertainty of the pandemic some employers will delay fall campus recruiting activities until the economy improves. Many will post jobs or download student resume books in the Handshake job portal instead of attending career fairs. It is important that you register in Handshake httpsutdallas.joinhandshake.com upload a resume and apply for jobs. Recruiters will also interact with students through virtual events in Handshake where they share information about their company and its technologies. Many will also utilize meetings with members of Jonsson School student organizations to create connections. If you haven\u2019t done so please consider joining one of our Go Comets! organizations. Once I receive updated information from our new slate of officers I will share the information with you.

    "body": "Dear Students and Friends Though it has been unique in every way students enrolled in the UTD choirs have been hard at work learning one of the most famous beloved important works in the choral-orchestral repertory. Mozart's Requiem Mass was composed in 1791 and to this day remains a work every choral singer knows and hopefully sings at some point in their lifetime. When I made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall I knew I had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. I also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. Mozart's Requiem is just that - engaging and attractive. Chamber Singers' soprano Dyuthi Arella writes \u201cEverything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. Our virtual choir experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice I\u2019m glad I made!\u201d As students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses I feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures of course. There will be more information forthcoming but I do hope you will continue to support choral music at UT Dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon. Best wishes for a healthy and productive fall season Dr. Jonathan Palant Associate Professor & Director of Choral ActivitiesCHECK THIS OUT! Meet University Choir freshman Max Grimm. In this video Max is demonstrating his ability to sing the Kyrie movement of Mozart's Requiem Mass in d minor. And here are more students rehearsing their choral music at home! #SafeSpace JOIN A UTD CHOIR THIS SPRING! Follow us on Facebook & Instagram!
