Another great ACM event.  See the link in the flyer if you have questions.





Hello!



ACM, in collaboration with other student organizations, is hosting a *12-hour
Hacktoberfest* event on *October 17th*! Apply today at
https://apply.acmutd.co/hack

!



We’re hosting workshops, speakers, and discussions about open source at UT
Dallas with our partner organizations, to help you navigate the world of
open source and introduce yourself to important concepts in Computer
Science, like version control.



Each division of ACM will be hosting an independent workshop which will
walk you through different steps of a project cycle and teach you how to *use
an API*, build a *personal website*, development with *React*, among many
other things.



At this event, you will have the opportunity to make 4 independent pull
requests on Github contributing to open source projects by ACM, allowing
you to *win a free shirt and swag*, courtesy of DigitalOcean. We also will
be giving participants an inside look into OpenSource development at UT
Dallas, make some very important announcements about these projects, and
show you how to get involved.



We’ll also have an amazing list of guest speakers to cover topics like the *MLH
fellowship*, *women in tech*, and transitioning into a successful cs career
from our *amazing network* of *ACM alumni* and *partner organizations*.



This event is completely free and you can register by going to
https://hacktoberfest.acmutd.co/

and
filling out the form. Make sure you join our discord

 (acmutd.co/discord
)
and verify with your first and last name to view the channels where the
event will be taking place!



If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know through an email
to hacktoberfest@acmutd.co, or by messaging a staff member on discord.



Thanks!

ACM Hacktoberfest Team
