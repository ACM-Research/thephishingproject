The interviewer will be assessing your stories and delivery to determine if you are the best fit for the position. \n\n \n\n1.      A good analogy for this is the process that actors use to prepare for their roles. They start by memorizing the script. Once the lines are memorized, the focus shifts to gaining mastery of the content delivery by practicing (rehearsing). This ensures that the narrative has a social and emotional impact on the audience. Be your own screenwriter by creating stories using situation or task, actions, and results statements in Power Point:\n\na.

By using this process to develop unconscious competence, you will be learning a life-skill that will have a major impact on your career. \n\n \nIf you haven\u2019t done so, I encourage you to create a LinkedIn profile.

By monitoring the daily feeds, you can view employer posts that have information about events and the recruiting process. One  of the easiest and best resources for creating an effective profile is the Learning LinkedIn for Students video by Oliver Schinkten. His video is one of many videos created by recruiting professionals to provide guidance  on your job search.  You can access the videos at the LinkedIn learning tab on the library\u2019s website.

I see that you\u2019re attending University of Texas at Dallas so I wanted to let you know we\u2019re actively on-boarding drivers (\u201cDashers\u201d) in your area to deliver food and other items from local merchants to hungry customers. In case you haven\u2019t heard of DoorDash before, we give customers an easy way to order delivery from well-known restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle, and from local restaurants including your college town favorites. \n\nDelivering with DoorDash (\u201cDashing\u201d) doesn't feel like being an everyday delivery driver. When you become a Dasher, you\u2019re your own boss and you can choose exactly when and where to work. You\u2019ll learn how to work with local businesses and have the opportunity to interact with people coming from a diverse set of backgrounds.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need a car -- you can deliver from your bike, motorcycle, scooter, or moped if you have one.\n\nI\u2019d love for you to sign up if it sounds interesting. You can get started by clicking below.\n\nThanks!\nScott\nDoorDash \nView the Message and Reply\n\nThank you, \nThe Handshake Team \n\nYou received this email because Handshake partners with your school to help you grow your career.
