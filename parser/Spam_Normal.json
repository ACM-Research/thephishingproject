    "body": "If you are interested in finding an internship or entry-level position, I encourage you to begin the preparation needed to be successful in your job search.\n\n \n\nWhen you interview, your role is to tell stories that describe your skills, experiences, and passion for your work during the interview. The interviewer will be assessing your stories and delivery to determine if you are the best fit for the position. \n\n \n\n1.      A good analogy for this is the process that actors use to prepare for their roles. They start by memorizing the script. Once the lines are memorized, the focus shifts to gaining mastery of the content delivery by practicing (rehearsing). This ensures that the narrative has a social and emotional impact on the audience. Be your own screenwriter by creating stories using situation or task, actions, and results statements in Power Point:\n\na.      Situation or task\u2014the most common situations are based on class projects, work experience, hobby projects, volunteer experiences, or student leadership activities.\n\nExample: As part of a four-person team, developed working prototype that met the needs of the professor or employer. \n\nb.      Actions-describe what steps you performed to achieve the desired outcome.  For most engineering tasks, the design process includes problem definition, problem analysis, development of possible solutions, and selection of the best solution. \n\n                                                    i.     Describe these steps with enough detail to highlight the top level actions and skills used to achieve the results. \n\nc.      Results\u2014what was the outcome of your actions and what did you learn? \n\n \n\n2.      Follow this step-by-step process to rehearse your stories. \n\na.      Print the notes of the PowerPoint stories and begin practicing your story in front of a mirror or recording on a device. \n\nb.      Use this practice to refine your delivery. Your stories will become much better and you will gain confidence in yourself. \n\nc.      Be sure to pay attention to the social and emotional aspects so that you come across as authentic, positive, confident, and capable. This step will prepare you to impress the interviewer. \n\nd.      Memorization is not enough.\n\n \n\n3.      Spending a few minutes each day will improve your ability to present yourself as a viable candidate.\n\n4.      As you start applying for jobs, be aware that many companies use applicant tracking systems that screen resumes for keywords, phrases, and text strings. Read the job descriptions carefully to make sure you are presenting the right information for each job/employer.\n\n \n\nFor many students, finding a job can be stressful process. By using this process to develop unconscious competence, you will be learning a life-skill that will have a major impact on your career. \n\n \nIf you haven\u2019t done so, I encourage you to create a LinkedIn profile. Employers view LinkedIn as another tool to learn about your skills and experiences. With a one page resume, you are limited in the information that you can share. LinkedIn allows you create a portfolio for your activities, employment, student organizational involvement, research, academic and hobby projects, and recommendations. and start connecting with Jonsson School students and alumni. By monitoring the daily feeds, you can view employer posts that have information about events and the recruiting process. One  of the easiest and best resources for creating an effective profile is the Learning LinkedIn for Students video by Oliver Schinkten. His video is one of many videos created by recruiting professionals to provide guidance  on your job search.  You can access the videos at the LinkedIn learning tab on the library\u2019s website. Once you have created a profile, click on my profile and then click on connect. I will accept your connection request and then you will be able to view my 23,000 LinkedIn connections. \n \n\nPlease continue to read my emails as I cover topics that help you prepare for career success. \n\n \n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\n \n\nJerry Alexander-Assistant Dean for Student Development\n\nDirector of  Industrial Practice Programs (Intern and Co-op) \n\nUT Dallas Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science \n\nSouth Engineering and Computer Science Building, room 2.502\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/internguy/\n\n972.883.4373\n "

I see that you\u2019re attending University of Texas at Dallas so I wanted to let you know we\u2019re actively on-boarding drivers (\u201cDashers\u201d) in your area to deliver food and other items from local merchants to hungry customers. In case you haven\u2019t heard of DoorDash before, we give customers an easy way to order delivery from well-known restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle, and from local restaurants including your college town favorites. \n\nDelivering with DoorDash (\u201cDashing\u201d) doesn't feel like being an everyday delivery driver. When you become a Dasher, you\u2019re your own boss and you can choose exactly when and where to work. You\u2019ll learn how to work with local businesses and have the opportunity to interact with people coming from a diverse set of backgrounds.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need a car -- you can deliver from your bike, motorcycle, scooter, or moped if you have one.\n\nI\u2019d love for you to sign up if it sounds interesting. You can get started by clicking below.\n\nThanks!\nScott\nDoorDash \nView the Message and Reply\n\nThank you, \nThe Handshake Team \n\nYou received this email because Handshake partners with your school to help you grow your career.
