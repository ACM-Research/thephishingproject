Before joining Nvidia 5 years ago, he was a CTO at Interphase and R&D engineer with Texas Instruments and Delphi. He received his PhD in 1998 from U of Illinois and has participated in creation of 10+ books, 6 special editions of major journals, and helped organize multiple workshops and conferences. In his spare time, Dr.Kisacanin is a passionate teacher of competitive math and physics at the AwesomeMath Academy and Summer Programs. We will discuss the applications of Deep Learning, what math lies behind deep learning(spoiler alert: linear algebra, multi-dimensional calculus, probability, and optimization theory, at least), and where the research might be going, so don't miss out!\n\n\n \n \nview this email in your browser \nCopyright \u00a9 2020 ACM UTD, All rights reserved.\nYou are receiving this email because you have opted in to the ACM UTD mailing list via our website, at an event, or by request.\n\nOur mailing address is:\nACM UTDUniversity of Texas at Dallas\nRichardson, TX 75080\n\nAdd us to your address book\n\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.\n "
