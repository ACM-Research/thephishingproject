You are strongly encouraged to read through this document and reach out to the Office of Community Standards and Conduct if you have any questions: OCSC@utdallas.edu. Additionally, per Federal legislation titled, “The Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988, and The Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989” ("Act "), “No institution of higher education shall be eligible to receive funds or any other form of financial assistance under any federal program, including participation in any federally funded or guaranteed student loan program, unless it has adopted and has implemented a program to prevent the use of illicit drugs and abuse of alcohol by students and employees”. The Act requires the annual distribution of this information to students and employees. The annual notification includes: 1) Standards of conduct. 2) Possible legal sanctions and penalties. 3) Statements of the health risks associated with alcohol and other drug abuse. 4) Alcohol and other drug abuse programs available to students, faculty and staff. 5) Disciplinary sanctions for violations of the standards of conduct. This email serves as The University of Texas at Dallas’ notification to students. Drug Free Schools and Communities Act Annual Notification ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS STANDARDS OF CONDUCT: Alcohol and Other Drugs The University of Texas at Dallas Policy Regarding Alcohol and Drugs Student Code of Conduct - UTDSP5003 Policy Statement Subchapter C. Student Standards of Conduct The dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under Subchapter D against a student accused of a violation of the Code of Conduct upon complaint by a faculty member, a student or other source. Any behavior which may have been influenced by the use of drugs or alcoholic beverages shall not in any way limit the responsibility of the student for the consequences of his or her actions. Disciplinary action may be initiated for misconduct, which includes: Alcohol: The unauthorized use or possession of alcoholic beverages unless permitted by law and/or University policy. This includes improper use, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverages, including but not limited to underage possession of alcohol, underage consumption of alcohol, providing alcohol to a minor, public intoxication, and/or driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Drugs: Unless authorized by state and federal law, the use, possession or manufacture of any drug or controlled substance or sale or distribution of any such drug or controlled substance, including unauthorized prescription medication. Drug Paraphernalia: The use or possession of equipment, products, or material used or intended for use in manufacturing, growing, using or distributing any drug or controlled substance. The complete Student Code of Conduct can be found at: UT Dallas Sanctions for Alcohol and Drug Violations These are POSSIBLE sanctions. The University of Texas at Dallas takes seriously its mission to educate students, and alcohol and other drug education (AOD) is our preferred method by which to address AOD-related issues. One educational goal is to inform students about AOD-related policies and laws and the consequences of violating them. The University will administer the following possible sanctions, at a minimum, for violations of the Student Code of Conduct related to alcohol and drugs; however, based on the severity of the infraction, the University reserves the right to impose any other sanction as deemed appropriate under the circumstances and in accordance with UTDSP5003 – Student Code of Conduct. First Offense Second Offense Third Offense Alcohol * Minor in Possession/Minor in Consumption: written reprimand * Other: developmental probation1 * Disciplinary probation2 * Suspension of rights and privileges as appropriate3 * Suspension or Expulsion Drugs * Disciplinary probation and suspension of rights and privileges3 or * Suspension (must be seen by the dean of students before being readmitted) * Expulsion * Suspension or Expulsion * Expulsion *Note 1 Developmental probation requires a student to satisfy conditions related to a violation such as counseling, AOD education, community service, etc. 2 Disciplinary probation identifies a specific time period during which the student or organization is required to comply with terms and conditions that include not engaging in further conduct that is in violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Further violations while on disciplinary probation may result in suspension or expulsion or the removal of an organization’s registration. 3 Suspension of rights and privileges is based upon the severity of the infraction as determined by the dean of students and may include, but is not limited to, prohibition from participation in extracurricular activities, living in campus housing, working on campus, or denial of use or access to facilities, etc. See Student Code of Conduct, Subchapter E, Section 49.25 for a complete listing of disciplinary sanctions and Subchapter C for student standards of conduct @ LEGAL SANCTIONS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW Texas State Law and Legal Sanctions Regarding Alcohol Penalties for Providing Alcohol to a Minor Anyone giving alcohol to a minor (even other minors) faces stiff penalties. The punishment for making alcoholic beverages available to a minor is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a fine up to $4,000, confinement in jail for up to a year, or both. Additionally, as of September 1, 2005, the violator will have his or her driver’s license automatically suspended for 180 days upon conviction. If the minor is under 18, the contributor can be held liable for damages caused by the intoxicated minor. Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) – 21 Years Old and Older The legal limit for intoxication in Texas is .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC). However, drivers can be stopped and cited for impaired driving due to alcohol or other drugs regardless of BAC. Texas also has a zero tolerance law. For anyone under 21, it is illegal to drive with any detectable amount of alcohol. What happens if you're stopped? If a law enforcement officer asks you to take a blood or breath test to measure how much alcohol is in your system and you refuse, you are subject to an automatic 180-day driver’s license suspension. Punishment for DWI varies depending on the number of times you've been convicted. First Offense * Up to a $2,000 fine * 72 hours to 180 days in jail * Driver’s license suspension: 90 days to 1 year Second Offense * Up to a $4,000 fine * 30 days to 1 year in jail * Driver’s license suspension: 180 days to 2 years Third Offense * Up to a $10,000 fine * 2 to 10 years in the penitentiary * Driver’s license suspension: 180 days to 2 years Consumption While Driving – Under 21 Years Old It is illegal for a minor to drive while having any detectable amount of alcohol in the system.

Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person’s ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses can cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just described. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening. Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver, and can also lead to sexual dysfunction. In addition, long-term heavy use of alcohol can cause digestive disorders, circulatory system disorders, and impairment of the central nervous system – all of which may lead to early death. Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants may have irreversible physical and mental challenges. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Tobacco and Nicotine Tobacco use is the number one cause of preventable death. Smoking can cause cancer, heart disease, stroke and lung disease. On average, smokers die ten years earlier than non-smokers. Smokers may also put those around them, when smoking, at risk of developing the same health issues as the smoker. There is no risk-free level of contact with secondhand smoke; even brief exposure can be harmful to health. – Center for Disease Control and Prevention Drugs (for a more complete list and added information: Stimulants Includes drugs such as: Cocaine, Methamphetamines, Amphetamines, Ecstasy, Ritalin, Adderall, Cylert. Physical effects: Elevated heart and respiratory rates, increased blood pressure, insomnia, loss of appetite, sweating, headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, and anxiety. High dosage can cause rapid or irregular heartbeat, loss of motor skills, tremors, physical collapse, and death. Long-term high dosage use can result in hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions. Study Drugs: Prescription stimulant drugs or “study drugs” are sometimes used by college students to enhance academic performance or to allow for sleeplessness to extend study time. They are typically prescribed to treat ADD/ADHD and are only safe if prescribed by a doctor, taken by the person prescribed for, and taken as directed. Federal law dictates it is illegal to take medication without a personal prescription. Students caught sharing or selling their prescription drugs, as well as those taking the drugs without a prescription face serious legal and academic sanctions. Inhalants Includes drugs such as: Glues, paint thinner, gasoline, laughing gas and aerosol sprays. Physical effects: When these substances are inhaled, or huffed, the body immediately becomes deprived of oxygen, causing rapid heartbeat and can result in sudden mental damage. In addition, dizziness, stimulant effects, distortion of time and place, difficulty walking, and a severe rash around the mouth and nose may result. Long-term use can result in liver damage, lung damage, and kidney problems. The high lasts a very short time, and when it wears off, many users experience headaches, nausea/vomiting, slurred speech, loss of motor coordination, and wheezing. Marijuana The concentration of THC in marijuana varies greatly but has an average potency of 8.52%. THC is a fat soluble substance and can remain in the lungs, liver, reproductive organs and brain tissue for up to three weeks. Smoking or ingesting marijuana can relax a person and elevate his/her mood. This can be followed by drowsiness and sedation. Other effects include heightened sensory awareness, euphoria, altered perceptions and feeling hungry (“the munchies”). High concentrations of THC may produce a more hallucinogenic response. The effects of marijuana may vary based on: expectations of the user; social setting; prior experience of the user; genetic vulnerability of the user (marijuana use may aggravate underlying mental health issues); and method of use (inhaled or ingested). Discomforts associated with smoking marijuana include dry mouth, dry eyes, increased heart rate, and visible signs of intoxication such as bloodshot eyes and puffy eyelids. Other problems include impaired memory and ability to learn; difficulty thinking and problem-solving; anxiety attacks or feelings of paranoia; impaired muscle coordination and judgment; increased susceptibility to infections; and dangerous impairment of driving skills. Combining marijuana and other drugs, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can cause unwanted reactions and/or increase the impact of both substances. Marijuana has addictive properties, and about 10-14% of users will become dependent. Tolerance to marijuana develops rapidly. Physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms from marijuana include irritability, restlessness, insomnia, nausea and intense dreams. Warning signs of dependence are: more frequent use; needing more and more to get the same effect; spending time thinking about using marijuana; spending more money than you have on it; missing class or failing to finish assignments because of marijuana; making new friends who use it and neglecting old friends who don’t; finding it’s hard to be happy without it. (From: Depressants Includes drugs such as: Barbiturates (Phenobarbital, Seconal, and Amytal), benzodiazepines (Ativan, Dalmane, Librium, Xanax, Valium, Halcion and Restoril), GHB, methaqualone, flunitrazepam, and tranquilizers. Physical effects: Short-term: slow brain function, lowered blood pressure, confusion, dizziness, fever, visual disturbances, disorientation, lack of coordination, difficulty or inability to urinate, slowed pulse and breathing, poor concentration, fatigue, slurred speech, sluggishness, dilated pupils, depression, addition. Higher doses can cause impairments in judgment, coordination, and memory and can also cause irritability, paranoia and suicidal thoughts. Opposite effects sometimes occur, such as aggression. Long-term effects include tolerance (needing more to get the intended effect), depression, sexual and sleep issues, chronic fatigue, breathing issues, heart problems, choking, liver failure and suicide. The risk of developing high blood sugar, diabetes, and weight gain are also symptoms of long-term use. Narcotics Includes drugs such as: codeine, Hydrocodone, Fentanyl, Oxycodone, Methadone, Hydromorphone, Morphine, opium, and heroin. Physical effects: Feelings of euphoria, drowsiness, nausea/vomiting, confusion, respiratory complications and pain relief. Overdose symptoms include: clammy skin, slow and shallow breathing, convulsions, coma and possible death. Addiction rates are high, and withdrawal symptoms can be severe. As some of these drugs are injectable, risk of contracting blood infections such as hepatitis or HIV is possible. This category of drug is most frequently associated with death as a result of brain, lungs and heart failure. Hallucinogens Includes drugs such as: LSD, PCP, ecstasy, Mollys, Magic Mushrooms. Physical effects: Dilated pupils, elevated body temperature, decreased appetite, insomnia, tremors, increased blood pressure. In addition, sense of direction, time and distance become disoriented, and speech can become blocked. Unpredictable, erratic and violent behaviors in users which can lead to serious injury and death. Psychological effects include confusion, anxiety, panic, paranoia, and loss of control. Long-term use can result in memory problems, speech difficulties, depression, anxiety and violent behavior. Hallucinogens can cause high psychological dependence resulting in the user taking higher doses. High doses can produce lung failure, convulsions, and coma. Flashbacks, which are delayed effects, can occur even after use has ceased. Anabolic Steroids Includes drugs such as: Anadrol, Durabolin, Dianabol, Oxandrin, Stanozol. Physical effects: Men may develop: Prominent breasts, baldness, shrunken testicles, and infertility. Women may develop: a deeper voice, an enlarged clitoris, increased body hair, and baldness. Both men and women might experience: severe acne, liver abnormalities and tumors, kidney diseases, increased (LDL) “bad” cholesterol, decreased (HDL) "good" cholesterol, hostility and angry outbursts, and psychiatric disorders such as depression, drug dependence, and infections or diseases such as HIV or hepatitis. Deaths linked to steroid use have occurred as a result of suicides, homicides, cancers, liver disease and heart attacks. Synthetic Marijuana, K2, Spice, Lazy Cakes, Bath Salts, Herbal Incense It is difficult to know exactly what reaction users will experience as the ingredients depend on the person creating the product. The most common side effects include high blood pressure, seizures, heart palpitations, breathing problems, lung problems and even death. Bath Salts have been in the news for the vastly erratic effect they have on users, including many episodes of violence.

Traditional SIEM solutions are failing to protect today’s infrastructure from the increasing volume and speed of threats and cyberattacks. Security operations (SecOps) teams spend far too much time and money on tasks such as infrastructure setup and maintenance. In this session, you’ll learn more about the key benefits of Azure Sentinel and how it can: Put the cloud and large-scale intelligence from decades of Microsoft security experience to work quickly. Ingest several log types at no cost including Microsoft Threat Protection products, Azure activity logs, and Office 365 audit logs. Make your threat detection and response smarter and faster with AI.

TITLE: Current Status and Future Directions in Wind Farm Modeling SPEAKER: Dr. Stefano Leonardi, The University of Texas at Dallas DATE: November 4, 2020 TIME: 2:00PM (EDT) REGISTER NOW Can't make the scheduled time? Register and we'll send you the recording of the complete webinar. ABSTRACT In recent years, the wind energy industry has experienced a considerable technological and economical expansion leading to the design of large and dense power plants. The flow within wind farms is affected by turbulence, atmospheric stability and topography. As the turbines are being placed closer together, in order to minimize capital costs (such as, e.g., land, transmission), the overall efficiency is being affected by wake interactions between upstream and trailing turbines. Numerical simulations have been instrumental to design wind farms and maximize the power production. However there are still open challenges. For example, a better understanding of the meso-microscale coupling is widely regarded as a key aspect for further development of wind energy (Veers et al., Science 2019). From a computational fluid mechanics perspective, the problem is challenging because the wind varies on time and length scales of the order of days and kilometres, while turbulence has length and time scales several order of magnitude smaller. Similarly, the effect of the topography on the flow field, on the fluctuations of power production and on the durability of the turbines is still an open area of research. In this seminar we will provide a background on the subject, review the basic numerical techniques to model wind turbines and present our recent results coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and our in-house high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation code (Santoni et al. Wind Energy 23, 2020). We will also discuss a stochastic approach to estimate the annual energy production and assess optimization strategies. BIOGRAPHY Stefano Leonardi is a professor at the[Macintosh HD:Users:leonardi:Pictures:sleo-picture.png] Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Texas at Dallas. He got a Master degree in Aeronautical Engineering (1999) and a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (2002) at the University of Rome "La Sapienza", Italy. He was Assistant Professor from 2006 to 2010 and Associate professor from 2010 to 2013 at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. He joined UTD in 2013. From 2007-2010 he was also Adjunct Professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy New York and since 2010 he is adjunct professor at the University of Southampton, UK. He is Associate Editor in Frontiers in Energy Research - Wind Energy. His research interests are in turbulent flows over rough walls, heat transfer, turbo-machinery, super-hydrophobic surfaces, wind turbines, cardiovascular flow, wildfire propagation and oceanography. His numerical results have contributed to an improved understanding of the effect of roughness on turbulent flows and heat transfer and clarified the mechanism of drag reduction in super hydrophobic and liquid infused surfaces. Leonardi's group has also contributed to develop SOWFA and a novel high fidelity CFD code, UTD-WF to model wind farms under realistic wind conditions and to evaluate control algorithms optimizing power production. Leonardi's research has been funded by National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, National Institute of Health, American Heart Association, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pratt & Whitney and Argonne National Lab.

Women in Engineering: Margaret Hamilton Computer pioneer Margaret Hamilton was critical to landing astronauts on the moon for the first time on 20 July 1969 and returning them safely a few days later. The young Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) computer programmer and working mother led the team that created the onboard flight software for the Apollo missions, including Apollo 11 . The computer system was the most sophisticated of its day. Her rigorous approach was so successful that no software bugs were ever known to have occurred during any crewed Apollo missions. “She symbolizes that generation of unsung women who helped send humankind into space,” said President Barack Obama in 2016 when he awarded Hamilton the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian award. In 2017, she was one of a handful of NASA women to be immortalized as a Lego figurine .

Cyber News Dutch Ethical Hacker Logs into Trump’s Twitter Account Last week a Dutch security researcher succeeded in logging into the Twitter account of the American President Donald Trump. Trump, an active Twitterer with 87 million followers, had an extremely weak and easy to guess password and had according to the researcher, not applied two-step verification. The researcher, Victor Gevers, had access to Trump’s personal messages, could post tweets in his name and change his profile. Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with de Volkskrant by the monthly opinion magazine Vrij Nederland. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible. --Huib Modderkolk, de Volkskrant Read More Become A National Member WiCyS membership gives you access to tons of amazing benefits, including: * Job Board * Conference Scholarships * Training Opportunities * Community Forum * Networking Opportunities * Free Virtual Events Membership is NOT required in order to attend WiCyS UTD events.

More than 36K+ joined us from 50+ countries, tuning into more than 1K sessions covering 40 topic areas in five languages. If you haven’t yet watched NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote, make sure to catch up here - you don’t want to miss the groundbreaking announcements across healthcare, data science, robotics, automotive, and more. Over its 11 years, NVIDIA GTC has always been about sharing innovative approaches, and exploring how accelerated computing and AI are transforming how we work and live. But GTC 2020 took this to a new level. It brought together an incredible collection of talent - developers, researchers, engineers, and technologists - from a variety of industries. More than 1400 people were trained on the latest AI, deep learning, and data science tools by our Deep Learning Institute , enabling them to shape the next generation of AI-powered applications. And new connections were made during online networking events that were, frankly, more successful than we ever thought possible. We’re very grateful for your participation. We’d also like to thank our 1,100 speakers and more than 80+ sponsors, who made this all possible. We hope you enjoyed attending GTC as much as we enjoyed hosting you. To help us make our next event better, I kindly ask you to provide your feedback through surveys in the GTC app or your registration dashboard . You can continue learning by exploring sessions you may have missed, or revisiting those you found most interesting, in the Session Scheduler any time over the next 30 days. We hope to see you again in the spring for our next GTC with even more breakthrough discoveries.

"Cisco did not advance any objectively reasonable defenses at trial,” Morgan reportedly wrote in his 167-page decision. “The infringing functionality was added to their accused products post-June 20, 2017, and resulted in a dramatic increase in sales which Cisco touted in both technical and marketing documents. --Phil Muncaster, Infosecurity Magazine Read More Become A National Member WiCyS membership gives you access to tons of amazing benefits, including: * Job Board * Conference Scholarships * Training Opportunities * Community Forum * Networking Opportunities * Free Virtual Events Membership is NOT required in order to attend WiCyS UTD events.

Please check it out and review the TA’s feedbacks. If there is any further question, feel free to contact me. It would be great if you consider the following items for the rest of the semester. It helps us to grade the next assignments faster. 1- Before attempting to create a draft of your solutions, please read the submission guidelines carefully. If you are asked to submit a single pdf file you are not supposed to upload any other types like word or more than one pdf file. We expect you to submit one pdf file for all 10 questions including the screenshot of the codes and results, also a debugged .rkt file for assignment#1, for example. We did not deduct any point if you had not followed those instructions (only for the first assignment) but if it happens in the future you will get a 10 points penalty unfortunately. 2- Please debug your codes before submission. If we are not able to run your code, you may lose all the points considered for that problem. 3- It is very helpful if you check out the questions asked on Piazza regularly. In that way, if you misunderstood a question there is this possibility that someone else asked it and you also find the hint there. For example, some of you did not get the point of question#1 about drawing the internal representation for the lisp lists however, it was asked on Piazza and the hint was given along with the slide number of the relevant lecture note. 4- Please try to read each question carefully. For instance, for questions#5, 6 and 7 you need to trace your code by one of the given examples but some of you ignored that part and consequently they lost 3 points for each. 5- Please choose your partner for quizzes and those two assignments you are allowed to work with a partner, only from the section you are enrolled. If you have enrolled in section 501 you cannot choose your partner from section 503, for example. Otherwise, there will be a 10 points penalty for the violation. I highly encourage you to figure out the solution to each problem according to the feedbacks posted on e-Learning if you couldn’t gain full credit of it. It will definitely help you to solve the mid-term or final exam’s problems easily. Best, Somayeh M."

Click here to view in a browser. Hi Jerry, Thanks again for expressing interest in the Software career track at Intel. I’d love to take this time to go in even more detail around what it means to be a software professional at Intel. WHAT WE DO Chip-making at Intel used to involve a lot of work in sequence, but processors, systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and other silicon products require more steps than before. This challenge spurred a new approach to getting Intel ® silicon and critical software stacks done right the first time: compressing tasks and doing more in parallel. Learn how Michale Greene’s team at Intel ensures that all the critical code needed to ship a product is ready to go at launch for our customers. This effort is called “Pre-Silicon Software Readiness”. PROJECTS THAT MATTER In April 2017, three prominent organizations in the high-tech world—Intel, Alibaba Cloud, and LinkDoc—brought top researchers and developers together in a competition to screen for lung cancer in its earliest stages using algorithms and AI. "Through this deep collaboration with Tianchi participants across the globe, the engineering teams obtained rich insights into the medical imaging analytic domain and better understood the commonality among different solutions. Through research and experimentation, we concluded that the traditional graphics processing unit (GPU) has limitations in this type of analysis while the central processing unit (CPU) has advantages." – Albert Hu, Senior AI and Big Data Solution Architect, Intel Corporation The team from Peking University won the event, besting the other 2,886 teams involved. However, the overall insights gained from this seven-month online project will benefit the entire global medical community.

When you interview, your role is to tell stories that describe your skills, experiences, and passion for your work during the interview. The interviewer will be assessing your stories and delivery to determine if you are the best fit for the position. 1. A good analogy for this is the process that actors use to prepare for their roles. They start by memorizing the script. Once the lines are memorized, the focus shifts to gaining mastery of the content delivery by practicing (rehearsing). This ensures that the narrative has a social and emotional impact on the audience. Be your own screenwriter by creating stories using situation or task, actions, and results statements in Power Point: a. Situation or task—the most common situations are based on class projects, work experience, hobby projects, volunteer experiences, or student leadership activities. Example: As part of a four-person team, developed working prototype that met the needs of the professor or employer. b. Actions-describe what steps you performed to achieve the desired outcome. For most engineering tasks, the design process includes problem definition, problem analysis, development of possible solutions, and selection of the best solution. i. Describe these steps with enough detail to highlight the top level actions and skills used to achieve the results. c. Results—what was the outcome of your actions and what did you learn? 2. Follow this step-by-step process to rehearse your stories. a. Print the notes of the PowerPoint stories and begin practicing your story in front of a mirror or recording on a device. b. Use this practice to refine your delivery. Your stories will become much better and you will gain confidence in yourself. c. Be sure to pay attention to the social and emotional aspects so that you come across as authentic, positive, confident, and capable. This step will prepare you to impress the interviewer. d. Memorization is not enough. 3. Spending a few minutes each day will improve your ability to present yourself as a viable candidate. 4. As you start applying for jobs, be aware that many companies use applicant tracking systems that screen resumes for keywords, phrases, and text strings. Read the job descriptions carefully to make sure you are presenting the right information for each job/employer. For many students, finding a job can be stressful process. By using this process to develop unconscious competence, you will be learning a life-skill that will have a major impact on your career. If you haven’t done so, I encourage you to create a LinkedIn profile. Employers view LinkedIn as another tool to learn about your skills and experiences. With a one page resume, you are limited in the information that you can share. LinkedIn allows you create a portfolio for your activities, employment, student organizational involvement, research, academic and hobby projects, and recommendations. and start connecting with Jonsson School students and alumni. By monitoring the daily feeds, you can view employer posts that have information about events and the recruiting process. One of the easiest and best resources for creating an effective profile is the Learning LinkedIn for Students video by Oliver Schinkten. His video is one of many videos created by recruiting professionals to provide guidance on your job search. You can access the videos at the LinkedIn learning tab on the library’s website. Once you have created a profile, click on my profile and then click on connect. I will accept your connection request and then you will be able to view my 23,000 LinkedIn connections. Please continue to read my emails as I cover topics that help you prepare for career success.

Facilitated by Dr. Stephanie Adams 12:00-1:00pm | Join Microsoft Teams Meeting | Please rsvp here There has been an increase in the level of the conversation about diversity in STEM. Most likely fueled by the current social movement that has achieved world-wide attention. We must take advantage of the current momentum and re-emphasize the need for diversity in STEM. Most STEM fields clearly are struggling to achieve a population that mirrors our national statistics, specifically in engineering. Women and racial/ethnic minorities continue to be underrepresented in nearly 100% of STEM fields. Utilizing data from the National Science Foundation and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), the audience will begin to understand the enormity of this task. Armed with this information the audience will gain a better understanding of the issues and challenges faced in diversifying STEM and hear evidenced based actions and recommendations, which will equip you to address them in a positive, proactive manner such that we can increase the representation of these marginalized groups.

For those interested in staying on-campus during the winter break this serves as a reminder that all campus housing will be open, including our residence halls. However, you must sign up for housing during the break if you are assigned to the residence halls before November 4. The link for the residence halls can be found here . Our staff are committed to providing you with a safe place to call home, and our preparation for your return or continued residence is based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local agencies. This week UT Dallas announced its course modalities for the spring semester. I am sure this announcement has led to some students questioning whether or not they would reside on campus for the spring semester. Let me remind you that the date to cancel your spring 2021 housing without penalty is November 1, 2020. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee priority for fall 2021 housing if you do cancel and move out and you would be required to reapply for fall 2021 housing in March 2021. In an effort to support the residential living experience, the University will be moving forward with plans to approve limited events and activities during the spring semester. We recognize the importance of being able to connect your friends and classmates, and we hope that these opportunities will allow all a way to experience this safely. Please see today’s News Center article for further information. The link to the article can be found here . If you wish to cancel your housing agreement, you may email our staff at housing@utdallas.edu to notify us of your intentions with “Cancellation 2021” in the subject line. If you are still planning to remain on campus for the spring semester no further action is required. Thank you. Matthew J.

I see that you’re attending University of Texas at Dallas so I wanted to let you know we’re actively on-boarding drivers (“Dashers”) in your area to deliver food and other items from local merchants to hungry customers. In case you haven’t heard of DoorDash before, we give customers an easy way to order delivery from well-known restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and Chipotle, and from local restaurants including your college town favorites. Delivering with DoorDash (“Dashing”) doesn't feel like being an everyday delivery driver. When you become a Dasher, you’re your own boss and you can choose exactly when and where to work. You’ll learn how to work with local businesses and have the opportunity to interact with people coming from a diverse set of backgrounds. You don’t even need a car -- you can deliver from your bike, motorcycle, scooter, or moped if you have one. I’d love for you to sign up if it sounds interesting. You can get started by clicking below. Thanks!

They will offer two virtual sessions, and you are welcome to attend one or both. Registration is required! Wednesday October 14 Deep Learning Overview for Images and Video with MATLAB 1:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m. WebEx Deep Learning is a key technology driving the current Artificial Intelligence (AI) megatrend. You may have heard of some mainstream applications of deep learning, but how many of them would you consider applying to your engineering and science applications? MathWorks developers have purpose-built MATLAB's deep learning functionality for engineering and science workflows. We understand that success goes beyond just developing a deep learning model. Ultimately, models need to be incorporated into an entire system design workflow to deliver a product or a service to the market. The aim of the session is to provide an overview of how MATLAB enables you to take advantage of disruptive technologies like deep learning. We will: * Show where deep learning is being applied in engineering and science, and how its driving MATLAB's development. * Demonstrate a workflow for how you can research, develop and deploy your own deep learning application. * Outline what MathWorks engineers can do to help support you achieve success with deep learning. Technologies demonstrated include: * Automating Ground Truth Image Labeling * Training and Evaluating an Object Detector * Generating optimized native embedded code Wednesday October 14 Data Analysis with MATLAB 3:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. WebEx In this session, you will learn how MATLAB can be used to visualize and analyze data, perform numerical computations, and develop algorithms. Through live demonstrations and examples, you will see how MATLAB can help you become more effective in your work. This session is targeted for those who are new to MATLAB. However, experienced MATLAB users may also benefit from the session, as the engineer will be covering some tips and tricks from the newer releases of MATLAB. Some of the highlights include: * Accessing data from many sources (excel, files, other software, hardware, etc.) * Using interactive tools for iterative exploration, design, and problem solving * Automating and capturing your work in easy-to-write scripts and programs * Sharing your results with others by automatically creating reports For more information on the workshops, contact Peter Sheridan at psherida@mathworks.com"

Mozart's Requiem Mass was composed in 1791 and, to this day, remains a work every choral singer knows and [hopefully] sings at some point in their lifetime. When I made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall, I knew I had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. I also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. Mozart's Requiem is just that - engaging and attractive. Singers' soprano Dyuthi Arella writes, “Everything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. Our virtual [choir] experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others, but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice I’m glad I made!” As students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses, I feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures, of course. There will be more information forthcoming, but I do hope you will continue to support choral music at UT Dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon. Best wishes for a healthy and productive fall season, Dr. Jonathan Palant Associate Professor & Director of Choral Activities CHECK THIS OUT! Meet University Choir freshman, Max Grimm. In this video, Max is demonstrating his ability to sing the "Kyrie" movement of Mozart's Requiem Mass in d minor.

Mozart's Requiem Mass was composed in 1791 and, to this day, remains a work every choral singer knows and [hopefully] sings at some point in their lifetime. When I made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall, I knew I had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. I also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. Mozart's Requiem is just that - engaging and attractive. Chamber Singers' soprano Dyuthi Arella writes, “Everything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. Our virtual [choir] experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others, but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice I’m glad I made!” As students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses, I feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures, of course. There will be more information forthcoming, but I do hope you will continue to support choral music at UT Dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon. Best wishes for a healthy and productive fall season, Dr. Jonathan Palant Associate Professor & Director of Choral ActivitiesCHECK THIS OUT! Meet University Choir freshman, Max Grimm. In this video, Max is demonstrating his ability to sing the "Kyrie" movement of Mozart's Requiem Mass in d minor. And here are more students rehearsing their choral music at home! #SafeSpace JOIN A UTD CHOIR THIS SPRING! Follow us on Facebook & Instagram!

Women in Engineering: Ada Lovelace London-born Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) had a passion and gift for mathematics from a young age. She is credited with being the world's first computer programmer , as she drafted plans for how a machine called the Analytical Engine could perform computations. The machine, invented by her friend, mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, is considered to be the first general computer.
