we'll send you the recording of the complete webinar. abstract in recent years the wind energy industry has experienced a considerable technological and economical expansion leading to the design of large and dense power plants. the flow within wind farms is affected by turbulence atmospheric stability and topography. as the turbines are being placed closer together in order to minimize capital costs such as e.g. land transmission the overall efficiency is being affected by wake interactions between upstream and trailing turbines. numerical simulations have been instrumental to design wind farms and maximize the power production. however there are still open challenges. for example a better understanding of the meso-microscale coupling is widely regarded as a key aspect for further development of wind energy veers et al. science 2019. from a computational fluid mechanics perspective the problem is challenging because the wind varies on time and length scales of the order of days and kilometres while turbulence has length and time scales several order of magnitude smaller. similarly the effect of the topography on the flow field on the fluctuations of power production and on the durability of the turbines is still an open area of research. in this seminar we will provide a background on the subject review the basic numerical techniques to model wind turbines and present

our largest-ever gtc has now wrapped up and  wow  what a week! more than 36k+ joined us from 50+ countries tuning into more than 1k sessions covering 40 topic areas in five languages. if you haven’t yet watched nvidia ceo jensen huang’s keynote make sure to catch up here - you don’t want to miss the groundbreaking announcements across healthcare data science robotics automotive and more. over its 11 years nvidia gtc has always been about sharing innovative approaches and exploring how accelerated computing and ai are transforming how we work and live. but gtc 2020 took this to a new level. it brought together an incredible collection of talent - developers researchers engineers and technologists - from a variety of industries. more than 1400 people were trained on the latest ai deep learning and data science tools by our deep learning institute  enabling them to shape the next generation of ai-powered applications. and new connections were made during online networking events that were frankly more successful than we ever thought possible. we’re very grateful for your participation. we’d also like to thank our 1100 speakers and more than 80+ sponsors who made this all possible. we hope you enjoyed attending gtc as much as we enjoyed hosting you. to help us make our next event better i kindly ask you to provide your feedback through surveys in the gtc app or your registration dashboard . you can continue learning by exploring sessions you may have missed or revisiting those you found most interesting in the session scheduler any time over the next 30 days. we hope to see you again in the spring for our next gtc with even more breakthrough discoveries. best greg estes vp developer programs nvidia follow us privacy center  contact us 2020 nvidia corporation.

park drive provo utah 84604 385 203 4999 terms of service privacy security statement unsubscribe 2020 qualtrics dear all assignments#1 has been graded and posted on e-learning. please check it out and review the ta’s feedbacks. if there is any further question feel free to contact me. it would be great if you consider the following items for the rest of the semester. it helps us to grade the next assignments faster. 1- before attempting to create a draft of your solutions please read the submission guidelines carefully. if you are asked to submit a single pdf file you are not supposed to upload any other types like word or more than one pdf file. we expect you to submit one pdf file for all 10 questions including the screenshot of the codes and results also a debugged .rkt file for assignment#1 for example. we did not deduct any point if you had not followed those instructions only for the first assignment but if it happens in the future you will get a 10 points penalty unfortunately. 2- please debug your codes before submission. if we are not able to run your code you may lose all the points considered for that problem. 3- it is very helpful if you check out the questions asked on piazza regularly. in that way if you misunderstood a question there is this possibility that someone else asked it and you also find the hint there. for example some of you did not get the point of question#1 about drawing the internal representation for the lisp lists however it was asked on piazza and the hint was given along with the slide number of the relevant lecture note. 4- please try to read each question carefully. for instance for questions#5 6 and 7 you need to trace your code by one of the given examples but some of you ignored that part and consequently they lost 3 points for each. 5- please choose your partner for quizzes and those two assignments you are allowed to work with a partner only from the section you are enrolled. if you have enrolled in section 501 you cannot choose your partner from section 503 for example. otherwise there will be a 10 points penalty for the violation. i highly encourage you to figure out the solution to each problem according to the feedbacks posted on e-learning if you couldn’t gain full credit of it. it will definitely help you to solve the mid-term or final exam’s problems easily. best somayeh m. keep

career track at intel. i’d love to take this time to go in even more detail around what it means to be a software professional at intel. what we do chip-making at intel used to involve a lot of work in sequence but processors systems-on-a-chip socs and other silicon products require more steps than before. this challenge spurred a new approach to getting intel ® silicon and critical software stacks done right the first time compressing tasks and doing more in parallel. learn how michale greene’s team at intel ensures that all the critical code needed to ship a product is ready to go at launch for our customers. this effort is called “pre-silicon software readiness”. projects that matter in april 2017 three prominent organizations in the high-tech world—intel alibaba cloud and linkdoc—brought top researchers and developers together in a competition to screen for lung cancer in its earliest stages using algorithms and ai. through this deep collaboration with tianchi participants across the globe the engineering teams obtained rich insights into the medical imaging analytic domain and better understood the commonality among different solutions. through research and experimentation we concluded that the traditional graphics processing unit gpu has limitations in this type of analysis while the central processing unit cpu has advantages. – albert hu senior ai and big data solution architect intel corporation the team from peking university won the event besting the other 2886 teams involved. however the overall insights gained from this seven-month online

you are interested in finding an internship or entry-level position i encourage you to begin the preparation needed to be successful in your job search. when you interview your role is to tell stories that describe your skills experiences and passion for your work during the interview. the interviewer will be assessing your stories and delivery to determine if you are the best fit for the position. 1. a good analogy for this is the process that actors use to prepare for their roles. they start by memorizing the script. once the lines are memorized the focus shifts to gaining mastery of the content delivery by practicing rehearsing. this ensures that the narrative has a social and emotional impact on the audience. be your own screenwriter by creating stories using situation or task actions and results statements in power point a. situation or task—the most common situations are based on class projects work experience hobby projects volunteer experiences or student leadership activities. example as part of a four-person team developed working prototype that met the needs of the professor or employer. b. actions-describe what steps you performed to achieve the desired outcome. for most engineering tasks the design process includes problem definition problem analysis development of possible solutions and selection of the best solution. i. describe these steps with enough detail to highlight the top level actions and skills used to achieve the results. c. results—what was the outcome of your actions and what did you learn? 2. follow this step-by-step process to rehearse your stories. a. print the notes of the powerpoint stories and begin practicing your story in front of a mirror or recording on a device. b. use this practice to refine your delivery. your stories will become much better and you will gain confidence in yourself. c. be sure to pay attention to the social and emotional aspects so that you come across as authentic positive confident and capable. this step will prepare you to impress the interviewer. d. memorization is not enough. 3. spending a few minutes each day will improve your ability to present yourself as a viable candidate. 4. as you start applying for jobs be aware that many companies use applicant tracking systems that screen resumes for keywords phrases and text strings. read the job descriptions carefully to make sure you are presenting the right information for each jobemployer. for many students finding a job can be stressful process. by using this process to develop unconscious competence you will be learning a life-skill that will have a major impact on your career. if you haven’t done so i encourage you to create a linkedin profile. employers view linkedin as another tool to learn about your skills and experiences. with a one page resume you are limited in the information that you can share. linkedin allows you create a portfolio for your activities employment student organizational involvement research academic and hobby projects and recommendations. and start connecting with jonsson school students and alumni. by monitoring the daily feeds you can view employer posts that have information about events and the recruiting process. one of the easiest and best resources for creating an effective profile is the learning linkedin for students video by oliver schinkten. his video is one of many videos created by recruiting professionals to provide guidance on your job search. you can access the videos at the linkedin learning tab on the library’s website. once you have created a profile click on my profile and then click on connect. i will accept your connection request and then you will be able to view my 23000 linkedin connections. please continue to read my emails as i cover topics that help you prepare for career success. best regards jerry alexander-assistant dean for student development director of industrial practice programs intern and co-op ut dallas erik

this fall. for those interested in staying on-campus during the winter break this serves as a reminder that all campus housing will be open including our residence halls. however you must sign up for housing during the break if you are assigned to the residence halls before november 4. the link for the residence halls can be found here . our staff are committed to providing you with a safe place to call home and our preparation for your return or continued residence is based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and state and local agencies. this week ut dallas announced its course modalities for the spring semester. i am sure this announcement has led to some students questioning whether or not they would reside on campus for the spring semester. let me remind you that the date to cancel your spring 2021 housing without penalty is november 1 2020. unfortunately we cannot guarantee priority for fall 2021 housing if you do cancel and move out and you would be required to reapply for fall 2021 housing in march 2021. in an effort to support the residential living experience the university will be moving forward with plans to approve limited events and activities during the spring semester. we recognize the importance of being able to connect your friends and classmates and we hope that these opportunities will allow all a way to experience this safely. please see today’s news center article for further information. the link to the article can be found here . if you wish to cancel your housing agreement you may email our staff at housing@utdallas.edu to notify us of your intentions with “cancellation 2021” in the subject line. if you are still planning to remain on campus for the spring semester no further action is required.

dear students and friends though it has been unique in every way students enrolled in the utd choirs have been hard at work learning one of the most famous beloved important works in the choral-orchestral repertory. mozart's requiem mass was composed in 1791 and to this day remains a work every choral singer knows and hopefully sings at some point in their lifetime. when i made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall i knew i had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. i also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. mozart's requiem is just that - engaging and attractive.

singers' soprano dyuthi arella writes “everything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. our virtual choir experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice i’m glad i made!” as students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses i feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures of course. there will be more information forthcoming but i do hope you will continue to support choral music at ut dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon. best wishes for a healthy and productive fall season dr. jonathan palant associate professor & director of

students and friends though it has been unique in every way students enrolled in the utd choirs have been hard at work learning one of the most famous beloved important works in the choral-orchestral repertory. mozart's requiem mass was composed in 1791 and to this day remains a work every choral singer knows and hopefully sings at some point in their lifetime. when i made the decision not to have in-person rehearsals this fall i knew i had to choose a piece that would attract the very best singers on campus. i also knew the piece had to engage even those singers brand new to choral music. mozart's requiem is just that - engaging and attractive. chamber singers' soprano dyuthi arella writes “everything has changed and we are all learning how to cope with new situations. our virtual choir experience cannot replace how it feels to sing with others but being able to grow as a musician during these uncertain times is a choice i’m glad i made!” as students begin to think about spring semester and registering for those courses i feel compelled to announce that we will resume in-person singing this spring - complying with the approved safety measures of course. there will be more information forthcoming but i do hope you will continue to support choral music at ut dallas and perhaps join us in a choir or at a concert very soon. best wishes for a healthy and productive fall season dr. jonathan palant associate professor & director of choral activitiescheck this out! meet university choir freshman max grimm. in this video max is demonstrating his ability to sing the kyrie movement of mozart's requiem mass in d minor. and here are more students rehearsing their choral music at home! #safespace join a utd choir this spring! follow us on facebook & instagram! ut dallas
