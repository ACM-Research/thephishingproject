# Analyzing the Targeted Nature of Phishing Attacks

## Objective
An email parser used to identify potential phishing attacks targeted towards college students. The parser extracts information, such as the sender, address, subject, content, and links. Alongside the parser, various tests will be conducted to test which factors can signify a phishing attempt. This information will be used to predict and categorize whether an email is harmless or an attempted phishing attack. The goal is to better understand and analyze the characteristics of emails that are sent to the students of UTD.
