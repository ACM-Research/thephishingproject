# The UTD Phishing Project

## Objective
An email parser used to identify potential phishing attacks targeted towards college students and administration. The parser extracts informtation, such as the sender, address, subject, content, and links. This information will be used to then categorize whether an email is potentially harmful, or an attempted phishing attack. The goal is to better understand and analyze the nature of phishing attacks aimed at colleges. Alongside with the parser, various tests will be run and collected as data.
